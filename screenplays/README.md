Here you can check out my screenplays!


Below is a list including titles and a brief description of each piece:

1. Broken & Bent - An introduction to Eric and Ronnie, two goofy roommates who push and pull on each other in the best and worst of ways!

2. The Gellar Program - A sci-fi drama about Cadet Therman and his revelations about the part he has to play in an ever-changing war that spans the galaxy.

3. Daily Mike: Help Wanted (WIP) - This is my concept for an adult, animated series about an average desk jockey who is conscripted to work for CHAOS Inc. when he prematurely perishes on the first day of his new job.
